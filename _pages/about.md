Hi, I'm Yifan Zhang (Skylar). I'm a Master's student at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC) supervised by [Prof. Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and [Prof. Qingyun Wang](https://eaglew.github.io)

My research interests lie in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **AI4Science**, especially chemistry and biology.
